## Features

- Entity component system (ECS)
- Model loading system
- Lighting system
  - Point, spot and directional light components
  - Shadow mapping
- UI to let the user manipulate the properties of every entity
- AABB collision detection

## Prerequisites

1.	Use the Windows 10/11 operating system
2.	Ensure you have CMAKE installed and added to the system path on your computer.
3.	Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed with the C++ workload.

## Build

If the above are all as stated, perform the following steps:

1.	When you pulled this repo from git, ensure that you used git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>  (otherwise, the assimp submodule will not be included)
2.	In the Solution Directory, navigate to dep/assimp
3.	In the “assimp” directory, open a bash terminal and type “cmake CMakeLists.txt” an push enter.
4.	Then type “cmake --build .” and push enter again. This will set up the assimp submodule.
5.	Now double-click the visual studio solution file in the solution directory “zenditeEngineV2.sln” to open it in Visual Studio 2022.
6.	Press F5 to build and run.

## Usage

Controls:

- W, A, S and D => Move flycam around the scene.
- Q and E => Hover Up and Down.
- C => Unlock mouse pointer (Which enables the user to use the mouse on the GUI).
- V => Lock mouse pointer to game window (Nouse will now control camera view direction).
- L and K => Toggle wireframe mode on and off.

## Dependencies

The following 3rd Party Libs were used in this project:

- GLFW => For window context creation

- GLEW => For retrieving OpenGL functions
	Link: https://glew.sourceforge.net/
- Assimp => for model loading
	Link: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
- Stb image => for texture image loading
	Link: https://github.com/nothings/stb
- glm => for maths operations (mainly for matrix and vector calculations)
	Link: https://github.com/g-truc/glm
- imgui => for the GUI implementation (implemented in menu.h)

Other 3rd Party Contributions:

- LearnOpengl.com's camera class implementation. (Implemented as Camera.h)
