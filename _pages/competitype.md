CompetiType is a typing speed Android app written in Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose and Firebase.

So far, the app includes google authentication, and a typing field with smooth cursor and scroll animations and information / graphs about how you type. The goal is to implement a multiplayer mode using Firebase. 
<p>
The textfield has been designed to be as adaptative as possible for users to be able to play on both tablets and smartphones : it handles screen rotations, and app resizing (if the app is open in a window). It also includes different languages, custom font size and test duration.
