<h2 class="hello">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm an engineering student at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, aiming to pursue research in computer graphics.

My interests include path sampling techniques like ReSTIR,
acceleration structures for ray tracing, material modeling,
and other topics related to realistic and efficient light
transport simulation for both real-time and offline applications.
